# K-Means

K-Means is a clustering algorithm. It is used to group data points into a specified number of clusters. The algorithm uses an iterative process to partition the data points into clusters. Initially, k centroids (cluster centers) are randomly selected, and each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid. Then, an average calculation is made for each data point with respect to the assigned centroids, and these new average points are designated as the new centroids. This process is repeated until there are no changes in the centroids or until a certain number of iterations are reached. As a result, data points are assigned to clusters, and each cluster is centered around its centroid. K-Means is used in various applications such as data mining, image processing, and pattern recognition.
